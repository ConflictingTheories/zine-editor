## NARRATIVE FRAMEWORK

### The World: Neo-Medieval Techno-Occult Reality

**Core Concept:**  
Present-day Earth exists in a state of "reality fracture" following an event known as **The Convergence** (circa 2019), when ancient magickal systems synchronized with digital infrastructure, creating a hybrid world where:

- Medieval orders of warrior-mages operate as corporate entities
- Demons manifest through corrupted code and AI systems
- Time flows non-linearly in certain zones (Temporal Anomaly Zones)
- Conspiracy theories are documented truths
- The boundary between myth and reality is permeable

**Tone:**  
Heavy Metal magazine meets Shadowrun meets medieval grimoire, filtered through darkly comedic lens. Everything is simultaneously deadly serious and absurdly over-the-top.

## EDITORIAL VOICE

### The Void Chronicles Speaks As:

**An Unreliable Chronicler:**  
The zine itself is a character—a grimoire that records the events of the fractured reality. It may have its own agenda.

**A Conspiracy Theorist Who's Right:**  
Everything sounds insane but is documented truth within the world.

**A Heavy Metal Album:**  
Epic, intense, unapologetically excessive, but with genuine emotional depth.

**A Tech Startup's Dark Grimoire:**  
Corporate language corrupted by occult terminology. Synergy spells. Quarterly demon summoning.

**A Time Capsule from Multiple Futures:**  
Articles may reference events from different timelines, creating intentional confusion.
